## What is Pong?
Pong is one of the oldest video games ever made (initially from 1972!). Two pads, one ball. One misses the ball - the other one gets one point.

## Description
This is my first Python game project I made using the Pygame library. It's a single-player game. The opponent pad is controller by highly intelligent AI which follows the ball position automatically. I added retro-looking custom font and corresponding 8-bit sound effects and suitable music to follow the retro vibe. The scoreboard counts the points for both the player and the AI. Whoever gets to 3 points first, wins.

## TODO
- Intro menu with buttons
- Win/lose condition when 3 points are scored
- Background music
- Visual FX on ball contact
