# the-pong-python
Project files for a Pong game made by Python using pygame

The Pong game for 1 player vs an AI opponent. I wanted to include as many features as I could.
Some of them were:
- collisions
- AI behaviour following the ball by itself
- scoreboard showing a current score

I plan to implement audio and pause menu into the game as a version 2.0 soon.
